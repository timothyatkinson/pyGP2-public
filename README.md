# pyGP2

pyGP2 is a python wrapper for the graph programming language GP 2. It lets you compile and use GP 2 programs from within python.

## Dependencies

To use pyGP2 you MUST have access to a working installation of P-GP 2. P-GP 2 has already been extended to handle interfacing with other C-code, which made it more suitable for use in the development of pyGP2. To install P-GP 2, visit https://github.com/UoYCS-plasma/P-GP2 and follow the installation instructions for non-super users (e.g. a local installation). Remember to keep the path to your P-GP 2 installation, which contains a 'bin', 'lib' and 'include' folder.

You will also need cython (see https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html), CPython 3.6+ (the default python downloaded from python.org).
